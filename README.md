# Template for my presentations

## How to create a presentation with this template

The file chapter1.tex contains some useful examples. Anyway, here is a quick rundown:

* All contents of a slide go inside a frame environment
* Use sections and subsections. This may seem unnecessary at first, but it enables latex to create a toc in the header. 
  Plus, a lot of pdf viewers make it easier to browse the presentation when you make proper use of sections.
* Beamer adds the definiton environment. Make use of it!
* Anything else is just like plain old latex.
